Current Known issues:
* device **sometimes** locks up, if stopping CLI with CTRL+C and restarting CLI.
* no continous autodetect (the Elgato stays at the resolution, it first auto-detected, even if the input source changes resolution)
* colorspace doesn't get auto-detected. Forcing colorspaces works though.
